                    <span>Maintaining a healthy diet is essential for physical health. The food you eat provides your body with the nutrients and energy it needs to function properly. A healthy diet can also help you maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of chronic diseases, and improve your overall well-being. When it comes to food and diet, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it's important to eat a variety of foods from all the different food groups. This means eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. By eating a variety of foods, you can ensure that your body is getting all the nutrients it needs to function properly.                
                        Another important aspect of a healthy diet is portion control. Eating too much of anything can lead to weight gain, which can increase your risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. By practicing portion control, you can enjoy all the foods you love without overeating.
                        
                        In addition to eating a healthy diet, it's also important to stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water can help keep your body functioning properly, improve digestion, and even boost your metabolism.
                        
                        When it comes to physical health, it's important to remember that what you put into your body matters. By eating a healthy diet that is rich in nutrients and low in unhealthy fats and sugars, you can help reduce your risk of chronic diseases and improve your overall well-being. So, make sure to prioritize your diet and give your body the fuel it needs to stay healthy and strong.</span>

                <ol type="number">
                    <li><b>Warm-up:</b> <span>Spend 5-10 minutes warming up your body with some light cardio, such as jogging in place or jumping jacks.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Push-ups:</b> <span> Do 3 sets of 10-12 push-ups (modified or regular). If regular push-ups are too challenging, start with modified push-ups by resting your knees on the ground. Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down by bending your elbows, keeping your body straight. Push back up to the starting position.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Bodyweight squats:</b> <span> Do 3 sets of 10-12 bodyweight squats. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees, and lower your hips down as if sitting in a chair. Keep your chest up and your weight on your heels.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Lungs:</b> <span>Do 3 sets of 10-12 lunges on each leg. Step forward with one foot, keeping your knee at a 90-degree angle. Lower your back knee down toward the ground, then push back up to the starting position.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Plank:</b> <span>Hold a plank for 30-60 seconds. Start in a push-up position with your forearms on the ground. Keep your body straight and your core engaged.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Jumping Jack:</b> <span>Do 3 sets of 30-60 seconds of jumping jacks. This will get your heart rate up and provide a cardiovascular challenge.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Cool-down:</b> <span>Spend 5-10 minutes cooling down with some light stretching, such as hamstring stretches or shoulder rolls.</span></li>
